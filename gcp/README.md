Interested in running Foundry VTT on GCP? Well, you're in the right place. The goal of this project is to enable you to run a Terraform script that will stand up your Foundry instance on GCP.

Directories:

* **ansible** - future Ansible scripts to configure application once Terraform stands it up
* **terraform** - Terraform plan to build GCP infrastructure

__Requirements__

* Terraform installed locally
* A GCP Service account
* Ansible installed locally

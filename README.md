All things Foundry VTT. Macros, links, scripts, etc.

This is my list of scripts, macros, etc that I have either made or found that work for Foundry VTT.

More info on Foundry VTT can be found [here](https://foundryvtt.com). You can find me on the Foundry Discord as - *Valien#6946* or the 
[/r/foundryvtt](https://www.reddit.com/r/foundryvtt) subreddit.

A lot of this stuff is a work in progress or missing content. So feel free to fork and play with anything and submitting a PR if you make a cool change/improvement/bug fix.

All things Foundry VTT. Macros, links, scripts, etc.

This is my list of scripts, macros, etc that I have either made or found that work for Foundry VTT.

**Check the different folders for content**

* *macros* - Has macros (wee!)
* *modules* - Has compendium packs, adventures, etc.

Macros should be self-documented but in case you have questions ping me on the Foundry Discord (Valien) or here on GitHub!
